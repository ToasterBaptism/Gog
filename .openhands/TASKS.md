# Task List

1. ✅ Restore TensorFlow Lite implementation for ball detection
Added TFLiteInferenceEngine class and TensorFlow Lite dependencies. Updated ScreenCaptureService to use TensorFlow Lite with fallback to stub.
2. ✅ Build v2.18 APK with TensorFlow Lite ball detection
Built both debug (105MB) and release (56MB) versions with proper APK naming convention
3. ✅ Debug why ball detection shows 0 balls found
CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED: Service was using detectBallSimple() instead of inferenceEngine.infer(). Fixed in v2.19 with proper TensorFlow Lite integration.
4. ✅ Build v2.19 APK with TensorFlow Lite properly integrated
Built v2.19 APKs with critical fix - service now uses TensorFlow Lite inference engine. Lowered confidence threshold to 0.25. Added comprehensive debugging.
5. ⏳ Test ball detection functionality with TensorFlow Lite
User needs to test v2.19 APK to verify that balls are now detected and overlay shows red circles. Should see 'Using inference engine: TFLiteInferenceEngine' in logs.
6. ✅ Update download page with v2.19 APKs
Updated download page with v2.19 APKs, proper naming, debugging instructions, and testing guidance. APKs available locally (too large for GitHub).
