# Task List

1. âœ… Debug why ball detection is completely failing
Found issues: threshold too high, false positive filter too strict, color detection too restrictive
2. âœ… Implement much more aggressive detection settings
Lowered threshold to 0.15f, disabled false positive filter, made color detection extremely permissive, changed weighting to 80% texture/20% color
3. âœ… Add manual drag-and-drop ball positioning
Added touch handling to overlay, yellow square for manual mode, drag and drop functionality
4. âœ… Add comprehensive detection debugging
Added detailed logging for similarity values, thresholds, and detection results
5. ðŸ”„ Build and test new detection system
