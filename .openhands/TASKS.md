# Task List

1. ‚úÖ Restore TensorFlow Lite implementation for ball detection
Added TFLiteInferenceEngine class and TensorFlow Lite dependencies. Updated ScreenCaptureService to use TensorFlow Lite with fallback to stub.
2. ‚úÖ Build v2.18 APK with TensorFlow Lite ball detection
Built both debug (105MB) and release (56MB) versions with proper APK naming convention
3. üîÑ Debug why ball detection shows 0 balls found
User reports balls not detected. Logcat shows only overlay messages, no service initialization. Need to investigate TensorFlow Lite initialization and confidence thresholds.
4. ‚è≥ Test ball detection functionality with TensorFlow Lite
User needs to test v2.18 APK to verify that balls are now detected and overlay shows red circles
5. ‚úÖ Update download page with v2.18 APKs
Updated download page with v2.18 APKs, proper naming, and comprehensive debugging instructions
