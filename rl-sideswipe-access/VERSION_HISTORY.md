# RL Sideswipe Access - Version History

## v2.7-LANDSCAPE-COORDINATE-FIX (Current)
**Release Date:** 2025-08-19  
**APK:** `app-release-v2.7-LANDSCAPE-COORDINATE-FIX.apk`  
**Size:** 49MB  

### üîß Major Fixes
- **Landscape Mode Support:** Fixed coordinate system mismatch for horizontal gameplay
- **Ball Position Accuracy:** Magenta indicator now appears on actual ball location
- **Prediction Alignment:** Trajectory lines follow proper ball path instead of flat lines
- **Search Area Optimization:** Focused detection for landscape layout (avoids UI elements)

### üéØ Technical Implementation
- Added orientation detection using WindowManager and display rotation
- Implemented coordinate transformation between detection and overlay systems
- Modified search areas: landscape uses center 80%, portrait uses upper 75%
- Added screen info passing from ScreenCaptureService to PredictionOverlayService
- Enhanced coordinate scaling and transformation in overlay rendering

### üêõ Root Cause Identified & Fixed
The "flat horizontal line" issue was caused by coordinate system mismatch:
- Game runs in landscape mode (horizontal)
- Detection system was designed for portrait orientation
- Ball detected in upper-middle area appeared as overlay in bottom-left corner
- **FIXED** by proper coordinate transformation and orientation detection

## v2.6-DEBUG-VISUAL-INDICATOR (Previous Debug)
**Release Date:** 2025-08-19  
**APK:** `app-release-v2.6-DEBUG-VISUAL-INDICATOR.apk`  
**Size:** 49MB  

### üêõ Debug Features
- **Visual Ball Position Indicator:** Bright magenta circle shows exactly where ball is detected
- **Crosshair Marker:** Precise detection coordinates with crosshair overlay
- **Enhanced Logging:** Comprehensive position, velocity, and detection region logging
- **Focused Detection Area:** Search limited to upper 75% of screen (avoid UI elements)
- **Smaller Grid Search:** 30px grid for better precision
- **Relaxed Validation:** Lower thresholds for debugging (2+ positions, 10+ pixels, 10+ px/s)

### üéØ Purpose
This debug version helped identify the root cause of the "flat horizontal line" issue by showing exactly where the ball was being detected versus where the prediction overlay appeared.

## v2.5-IMPROVED-DETECTION
**Release Date:** 2025-08-19  
**APK:** `app-release-v2.5-IMPROVED-DETECTION.apk`  
**Size:** 49MB  

### üîß Improvements
- **Enhanced Gray Ball Detection:** Broader color ranges and improved variance tolerance
- **Dark Metallic Ball Detection:** For shadowed areas (brightness 50-120, variance <30)
- **Better Prediction Validation:** Minimum 3 ball positions and 20+ detected pixels required
- **Speed Threshold:** Minimum 50px/s to avoid showing predictions for detection noise
- **Enhanced Notifications:** Show ball history size, velocity, and speed information
- **Improved Flexibility:** Brightness range 80-220, color variance <50, broader RGB ranges

### üêõ Issues Fixed
- Gray/silver ball detection in various lighting conditions
- False positive predictions from detection noise
- Improved ball detection reliability and prediction triggering

## Development Notes

### Current Issues (v2.6)
1. **Coordinate System Mismatch:** Ball detection coordinates don't align with overlay rendering
2. **Flat Line Predictions:** Trajectory shows as horizontal line instead of proper curve
3. **Short Prediction Duration:** Predictions disappear too quickly
4. **Detection Accuracy:** Algorithm may be detecting wrong objects instead of actual ball

### Next Version Goals (v2.7)
- [ ] Fix coordinate system alignment between detection and overlay
- [ ] Improve ball detection accuracy to focus on actual ball vs field elements  
- [ ] Adjust validation thresholds to prevent predictions disappearing too quickly
- [ ] Add visual debugging indicators to show detected vs actual ball position
- [ ] Implement coordinate transformation if needed for different screen orientations

### Build Process
Use the automated version update script:
```bash
cd android
./update-version.sh "2.7-COORDINATE-FIX" "Fixed coordinate system mismatch"
```

This will:
1. Update versionCode and versionName in build.gradle
2. Build the release APK
3. Copy to webserver with proper naming
4. Display next steps for web page updates and git commits
