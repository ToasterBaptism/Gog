# Task List

1. ✅ Analyze stub vs tflite flavor implementations
TFLite flavor has comprehensive implementation with model loading, preprocessing, Hanning window, proper inference pipeline. Stub only has basic interface.
2. ✅ Examine ball template images quality and coverage
10 high-quality 60x60 PNG templates covering bright/dark/normal lighting conditions - excellent coverage
3. ✅ Audit existing TensorFlow Lite implementations
Found 6.6KB TFLite model, comprehensive inference engine with preprocessing, Hanning window, proper buffer management. Main code already has dynamic TFLite loading.
4. ✅ Consolidate best code from both flavors
Created comprehensive TFLiteInferenceEngine in main source with 13 TF Lite best practices. Updated factory pattern and removed flavor dependencies.
5. ✅ Enhance TensorFlow Lite integration with 10 recommended implementations
Added TensorFlowLiteUtils with 20 TF Lite best practices: advanced preprocessing, NMS, performance monitoring, memory optimization, etc.
6. 🔄 Update project structure for unified TensorFlow Lite support
Removing flavor-specific directories and ensuring unified structure
7. ⏳ Test complete TensorFlow Lite integration
Build and verify the enhanced TF Lite implementation works correctly
