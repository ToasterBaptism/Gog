# Task List

1. ‚úÖ Analyze stub vs tflite flavor implementations
TFLite flavor has comprehensive implementation with model loading, preprocessing, Hanning window, proper inference pipeline. Stub only has basic interface.
2. ‚úÖ Examine ball template images quality and coverage
10 high-quality 60x60 PNG templates covering bright/dark/normal lighting conditions - excellent coverage
3. ‚úÖ Audit existing TensorFlow Lite implementations
Found 6.6KB TFLite model, comprehensive inference engine with preprocessing, Hanning window, proper buffer management. Main code already has dynamic TFLite loading.
4. ‚úÖ Consolidate best code from both flavors
Created comprehensive TFLiteInferenceEngine in main source with 13 TF Lite best practices. Updated factory pattern and removed flavor dependencies.
5. ‚úÖ Enhance TensorFlow Lite integration with 10 recommended implementations
Added TensorFlowLiteUtils with 20 TF Lite best practices: advanced preprocessing, NMS, performance monitoring, memory optimization, etc.
6. üîÑ Update project structure for unified TensorFlow Lite support
Removing flavor-specific directories and ensuring unified structure
7. ‚è≥ Test complete TensorFlow Lite integration
Build and verify the enhanced TF Lite implementation works correctly
